 Data Retrieval & Analysis
Part A: Querying Using MongoDB Operators

In this part, different MongoDB operators are used to retrieve data:

Comparison operators ($gt, $lt, $gte, $lte)

Logical operators ($and, $or)

Element operators ($exists, $type)

Evaluation operators ($regex, $expr)

Array operators ($all, $size, $elemMatch)

Part B: Aggregation Framework

Aggregation pipelines are used to:

Calculate total admissions per course

Count students by admission status

Identify most requested career domains

Count event registrations

Generate paginated reports

Part C: Indexing, Sorting, and Pagination

Indexes are created on frequently queried fields to improve performance

Sorting is done using sort()

Pagination is implemented using skip() and limit()

Document counting is done using countDocuments() and estimatedDocumentCount()

Backup and MongoDB Atlas

The database is connected to MongoDB Atlas using MongoDB Compass

Backup is created by exporting collections in JSON format using MongoDB Compass

Screenshots of Atlas connection and backup are included in the repository

Tools Used

MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

MongoDB Atlas

GitHub

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how MongoDB can be used to design, manage, and analyze a college information system.
It covers data insertion, updating, querying, aggregation, indexing, and backup operations using MongoDB Compass Shell.
